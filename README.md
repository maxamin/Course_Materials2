## Introduction

The Splint Compiler provides a streamlined framework for learning the fundamentals of compiler design. It simplifies the processes involved in lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation, making it an excellent resource for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Understand and modify different compiler components like the lexer, parser, and code generator.
- **Example Projects:** Includes sample compilers to demonstrate various concepts.
- **Extensive Documentation:** Guides and tutorials on compiler construction.
- **Interactive Debugging:** Tools for visualizing and debugging the compilation process.

## Download

### Download Latest Release

1. **Visit the Releases Page:**
   - Go to the [Splint Compiler Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/splint-compiler/releases) page.

2. **Download the Latest Release:**
   - Choose the appropriate archive (`.zip` or `.tar.gz`) from the list and download it to your machine.

3. **Extract the Archive:**
   - Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to your desired location.

### Clone the Repository

Alternatively, you can clone the repository to get the latest version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxamin/Splint-3.1.1.git
## Use Cases in Education

### 1. **Learning Compiler Fundamentals**

Splint Compiler covers the essential phases of compilation:

- **Lexical Analysis:** Converts source code into tokens.
- **Parsing:** Transforms tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Semantic Analysis:** Validates the semantics of the code.
- **Code Generation:** Generates target code from the AST.

Each phase is modular, allowing students to focus on and understand each stage individually. This modularity makes it easier to grasp how each component works and how they interact with each other within a compiler.

### 2. **Hands-On Projects**

Splint provides templates and examples for creating simple compilers. These projects allow learners to gain practical experience and deepen their understanding of compiler construction. Example projects include:

- **Arithmetic Expression Evaluators:** Build a compiler that can evaluate arithmetic expressions.
- **Mini-Language Compilers:** Create a compiler for a simple, custom-designed language.
- **Syntax Highlighters:** Develop a syntax highlighter for a new or existing language.

These projects can help students apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios, enhancing their learning experience.

## Building a Custom Compiler

Splint Compiler provides a flexible framework for building custom compilers. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Create a New Project:**
   - Use the templates provided in the `templates` directory to start a new compiler project.
   
2. **Define the Grammar:**
   - Outline the lexical and syntactic rules of your custom language in a grammar definition file.

3. **Implement Compiler Components:**
   - Develop the necessary components, such as the lexer, parser, and code generator, based on your language’s requirements.

4. **Test and Debug:**
   - Utilize the debugging tools provided to visualize the compilation process and troubleshoot any issues.

Refer to the [Developer Guide](docs/developer_guide.md) for detailed instructions on creating and testing your custom compiler.
